# WINE COLLECTION

Code case made for IMPACT.

## Introduction

My test was to make a wine collection web-app, including a list of bottles, details and the ability to add a new bottle.

#### Initial thoughts

I started by doing some research on possible techonologies that could be used for making such a web-app, with my own skills in mind. 
I knew Angular would be good, however I felt that my skill was lacking, as I hadn't had much time with Angular yet. I also considered only making it with JavaScript.

I ended up deciding on making it with ASP.NET, it looked optimal, and I thought it would be something very familiar to me, considering my former education, where we used ASP.NET and linQ to build websites.


#### Problems

I started experiencing problems, due to it being a lot different to what I was used to. Working with views was unfamiliar to me, and the code behind was quite different too, however I had already gotten in too deep, so I wanted to see it through, and at least better myself.

I had to opt to a lot of guides and google searches, and in the end I couldn't solve all the issues I had.

```
Modals did not open as intended, with the IDs data.
```
```
Creating new bottles worked, however delete and edit did not.
```


#### Alternative

Since I had already started to work on something where I pulled json data out, in an angular project instead, I decided to touch up on that and add it to my repo, as an example of other things I've worked on.

### Reflection

In hindsight, I would have liked to just work with something I knew I could do. I need to compromise and be patient with myself and my own skill level. 
I wish to learn, however I am not very familiar with web-apps yet. Angular is still very new to me, ASP.NET MVC is completely new to me, so it was either too ambition or too foolhardy.

If I had gotten the same test again, I would have just made it with plain JavaScript and HTML/CSS, and then probably make use of an API.

Despite the result, I am still glad I learned something new.
